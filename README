Shell-SQP

SQP is a rapid SQL prototyping shell.  It's meant to provide a power
shell for SQLite3 and Perl by means of which you can quickly explore
different data organization and manipulation techniques as you learn
about a given domain.

It can be used as the basis for subclassed power tools, but it's
probably not your best bet for something an end user should be given.

A SQP setup consists of:
 - An SQLite3 database defined with high-level commands
 - Arbitrary .pm files defining local packages extending
   the ORM and/or the CLI
 - Arbitrary .pl files defining commands accessible from the CLI

The SQL select,insert,update,delete commands are exposed in the CLI;
select commands return a pretty-printed result.  Update and delete
commands ask for confirmation if you forget the "where" clause (I
shoot myself in the foot with that regularly).

More functionality to come; I'm using this as the basis for my 
job management system as a character-building exercise.
